# Setup Julia Repo in GitHub with Actions

## Install Julia

Basically if you are using Linux or Mac, you can easily install Julia by the package manager.
For Gentoo, we can install it with portage as following.

```shell
$ sudo emerge -av julia

```

The problem to install Julia by [Gentoo package manager](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage)
is slow upgrade speed.
In this time, July 27 2023, latest stable version version of Julia in the
[official site](https://julialang.org/downloads/) is 1.9.2 but Gentoo still has
1.8.5 as the latest one.
To overcome this gap, according to the instruction in [Julia GitHub](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia)
we can easily install it by compiling source.

```shell
$ cd localgit  <-- local git directory
$ git clone https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia.git
$ cd julia
$ git checkout v1.9.2  <-- tag for latest version
$ make
$ ln -s julia ~/.local/bin/julia  <-- This should be earlier path than /usr/bin/julia
```

## Setup Julia language server with formatter for Neovim

!!! info

    This setup is based on cloned
    [Neovim-from-scratch](https://github.com/erdosxx/Neovim-from-scratch/tree/27_Julia_REPL)
    and [Github repo: evoagile_configs](https://github.com/erdosxx/evoagile_configs) repo.

To setup LSP([Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)) with
[julials.lua](https://github.com/erdosxx/Neovim-from-scratch/blob/27_Julia_REPL/lua/user/lsp/settings/julials.lua)
file in [Neovim-from-scratch](https://github.com/erdosxx/Neovim-from-scratch/tree/27_Julia_REPL),
we need to setup `nvim-lspconfig` environment first.
Using [stow](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-admin/stow) tool,
we can copy `Makefile` to `~/.julia/environments/nvim-lspconfig/`.

```shell
$ cd localgit/evoagile_configs   <-- if your local cloned repo is in localgit
$ stow -t ~ julia
$ cd ~/.julia/environments/nvim-lspconfig/
$ make
```

After `make` command, `neovim` is launched and open `Example.jl` source file with
some errors. If you wait a moment and no problem occur to install, you can find
some bullets as following screenshot.

![Example.jl with bullets](../assets/julia_lsp_result.png)

Then just quit `neovim` and continue and finish installation.
To test installation, open any example Julia file and change keyword `function` to
`func tion` and at the same line, input `gl`. If you have some bullets and
messages as following, your installation is successful.
![Success to install](../assets/julia_lsp_install_success.png)

If you have any error to load Julia LSP, you can find following errror message in `neovim`.
![Fail message](../assets/julia_lsp_error.png)

As you can find in the following, `LanguageServer` package depends on
`JuliaFormatter`, `StaticLint`, and `SymbolServer`. That means we do not have to
install `JuliaFormatter` separately.

```@example
using Pkg
Pkg.add("LanguageServer")

```

To format your code, you can find related commends in
[keymaps.lua](https://github.com/erdosxx/Neovim-from-scratch/blob/27_Julia_REPL/lua/user/keymaps.lua)
file. Type `:Format` in command or `<space key>f`(when `<localleader>` = `<space key>`)
in normal mode, whole code in the file will be formatted.

!!! info

    To get supported to Julia formatting, we can also try to use
    [JuliaFormatter.vim](https://github.com/kdheepak/JuliaFormatter.vim).
    This only supports formatting and no other LSP function but
    range format supporting in visual mode and
    definition of format option in configuration file are possible.
    This uses [JuliaFormatter](https://github.com/domluna/JuliaFormatter.jl)
    independently.
    However, I found that when we use Julia LSP with this package, LSP was
    crashed occasionally. So I decided to uninstall it.

To define format parameters in Julia code is not easy in
[LSP configuration file](https://github.com/erdosxx/Neovim-from-scratch/blob/27_Julia_REPL/lua/user/lsp/settings/julials.lua).
The solution is use ['.JuliaFormatter.toml'](https://domluna.github.io/JuliaFormatter.jl/dev/config/)
file in every repo. So it can be convenient to add this file to
PkgTemplates. (See below section)

!!! info

    The useful configuration to format is
    - style = "sciml"
    - indent = 2
    - margin = 79
    For style options, see [YAS](https://domluna.github.io/JuliaFormatter.jl/dev/yas_style/),
    [Blue](https://domluna.github.io/JuliaFormatter.jl/dev/blue_style/), and
    [SciML](https://domluna.github.io/JuliaFormatter.jl/dev/sciml_style/).

!!! tip

    The shortcut keys to use LSP is defined in
    [`handler.lua`](https://github.com/erdosxx/Neovim-from-scratch/blob/master/lua/user/lsp/handlers.lua)
    Some useful keys are
    - `gl`: read diagnostics messages
    - `gd`: Go the the definition
    - `K`: Get help for functions, variables and so on.
    - `gr`: Get references or usages of functions. Looks only supported in the same file.
    - `<leader>la`: Add code actions. For example add docstrings after definding function.
    - `<leader>lr`: rename function. Looks only supported in the same file.

## Use [PkgTemplates](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl) to generate repository

PkgTemplates simplifies the process of setting up the initial file structure for
a new repository, specifically [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
integration with GitHub actions.
To use PkgTemplates, we recommend to install it in system default Julia environment,
for example, `v1.9` as following.

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate()   # activate system default env
Pkg.add("PkgTemplates")
```

After installing it, we need to setup the template. It would be convenient to keep it
in the
[`startup.jl`](https://github.com/erdosxx/evoagile_configs/blob/master/julia/.julia/config/startup.jl)
file for easy reuse.
Because this file runs every time Julia starts up, we can utilize the generate
function as shown in the following example.

```julia
function genGithubRepo(userName::String, repoName::String)
  templateGithub = Template(;
    user = userName,
    dir = "~/localgit",
    julia = v"1",  # for [compat] section in Project.toml
    plugins = [
      # Use semantic version, See Julia Pattern book page 43.
      ProjectFile(; version = v"1.0.0-DEV"),
      License(; name = "MIT", path = nothing, destination = "LICENSE"),
      Git(;
        branch = LibGit2.getconfig("init.defaultBranch", "master"),
        ssh = true,
        jl = true,
        manifest = false),
      GitHubActions(;
        destination = "CI.yml",
        linux = true,
        osx = false,
        windows = false,
        x64 = true,
        x86 = false,
        coverage = true,
        extra_versions = ["1.8", "1.9", "nightly"]),
      CompatHelper(; destination = "CompatHelper.yml", cron = "0 0 * * *"),
      TagBot(;
        destination = "TagBot.yml",
        trigger = "JuliaTagBot",
        token = Secret("GITHUB_TOKEN"),
        ssh = Secret("DOCUMENTER_KEY"),
        ssh_password = nothing,
        changelog = nothing,
        changelog_ignore = nothing,
        gpg = nothing,
        gpg_password = nothing,
        registry = nothing,
        branches = nothing,
        dispatch = nothing,
        dispatch_delay = nothing),
      Codecov(),
      Documenter{GitHubActions}(logo = Logo(;
        light = homedir() * "/.config/logo/logo.png",
        dark = homedir() * "/.config/logo/logo-dark.png")),
      Dependabot(),
    ])
  generate(templateGithub, repoName)
end

genGithubRepo("ecoinfos", "JuliaStudy.jl")
```

To run above code, folowwing things are needed.

- Logo files in `$HOME/.config/logo`. For example, use `stow` command to my
  [evoagile_configs](https://github.com/erdosxx/evoagile_configs)
  repository to setup `evoagile` logos as following.

```shell
$ cd localgit/evoagile_configs
$ stow -t ~ logo
```

- DOCUMENTER_KEY.
  This is required for deploying documents and
  can be generated by [`DocumeterTools`](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/man/hosting/#travis-ssh).

- [CompatHelper](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/CompatHelper.jl) access permission to pull request.
  Go to GitHub organization(Ex. ecoinfos) -> settings -> Actions -> General and set options
  with `Read and write permissions` and `Allow GitHub Action to create and approve pull requests`.
  After this organization setting, we can setup repository setting as the same way.
  **That is, without organization setting, we cannot change permission in repository setting.**
  Without this options, you can get error messages as like this.

```json
{
    "message":"GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests.",
    "documentation_url":
    "[https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#create-a-pull-request]
    (https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#create-a-pull-request)"}""",
    HTTP.Exceptions.StatusError(403, "POST",
    ...
}
```

!!! info

    The initial version, v"1.0.0-DEV" looks a bit strange because it starts from
    1.0. However this is for
    [semantic versioning](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/compatibility/#Version-specifier-format).
    A major version number of zero is specialâ€”it basically means that every new release is breaking.
    See also,
    [design patterns book for julia](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-design-patterns-and-best-practices-with-julia/9781838648817)
    page 43.

## Use [GitHub-CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to create repository in GitHub

Because `PkgTemplates` only make repository in `localgit` folder we need to
register it in GitHub. Basically this can be possible in GitHub Web page
but [GitHub-CLI](https://cli.github.com/) tool make this more easy.
In Gentoo, we can install it as following.

```shell
$ sudo emerge -av github-cli
$ gh auth login
```

After some authentication step, we can access, create and sync
an example repository as following.

```shell
$ gh repo list "ecoinfos"   # check the list of repo in ecoinfos user.
$ gh repo create "ecoinfos/JuliaStudy.jl" --public

# This repo is required to publish document to GitHub.
$ gh repo create "ecoinfos/ecoinfos.github.io" --public

$ cd localgit/JuliaStudy
$ git push origin HEAD --tags
```

## Playing with [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)

To setup REPL, [`andreypopp/julia-repl-vim`](https://github.com/andreypopp/julia-repl-vim) is installed in
[`newvim`](https://github.com/erdosxx/Neovim-from-scratch/blob/27_Julia_REPL/lua/user/plugins.lua)
(already installed in Neovim-from-scratch)
and Julia default environment as following.

```shell
$ julia    # install in default env.
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("url="https://github.com/andreypopp/julia-repl-vim"")
```

Because the [`startup.jl`](https://github.com/erdosxx/evoagile_configs/blob/master/julia/.julia/config/startup.jl)
file contains required startup commands, we can use it without manual setup.

```julia
using REPLVim
@async REPLVim.serve()
```

Once REPL is launched in another terminal and open a Julia file,
we can connect the code to REPL by `:JuliaREPLConnect` or `<localleader>o`.
To send some codes to REPL,

- `<localleader>u` In normal mode, send the cursor line to REPL.
  In visual mode, send the range to REPL.
- `<localleader>/` Format and send code whose block has same indented level.

## To do or practice

1. Add '.JuliaFormatter.toml' file to `PkgTemplates` to define format option.
2. Try to understand GitHub security model with secret keys.
   See [SSH Deploy Keys Walkthrough](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/man/hosting/walkthrough/#Adding-the-Public-Key-to-GitHub)
   and [security hardening for github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions).
